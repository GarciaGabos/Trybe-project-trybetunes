## About
&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a project developed during my studies at Trybe. In this project, I developed a music application. The user can search for artists listed on the 'iTunes API'. My goal was to develop a page based on the requirements given by 'Trybe'.



## Technologies:
All technologies applied by me on this project:
- React (with Redux and React Router)
- Javascript;
- CSS;
- HTML;

## How to run the project:
- Git clone the repository;
- Navigate to the folder and install the dependencies with `npm install`;
- Done! Now you can start the application with `npm start`!
